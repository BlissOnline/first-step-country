Bangladesh is one of Asia’s most rewarding off-beat secrets—home to the world’s largest mangrove forest (the Sundarbans), 120 km of empty golden sand at Cox’s Bazar, and vibrant river-city life in Dhaka and Barisal. You’ll meet unforgettable hospitality, feast on fiery street curries, and dive into centuries-old Sufi shrines without ever breaking your budget.

  paragraph="Visit between November and February for cooler weather and lively holidays like Pohela Boishakh, when cities hum with colour and music. In Dhaka, hostel beds start at less than the price of a cappuccino at a trendy café, while boutique hotels and serviced apartments deliver comfort without draining your wallet. Venture further and you’ll find Sylhet’s tea‑garden guesthouses, coastal cottages in Kuakata, and island stays on Saint Martin’s—all often costing less than you’d expect. Whether you’re a digital nomad chasing reliable Wi‑Fi, a backpacker stretching each dollar, or a luxury seeker after a steal, your perfect night’s sleep in Bangladesh is just a booking away."
