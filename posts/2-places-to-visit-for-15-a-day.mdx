Bangladesh is one of Asia’s most rewarding off-beat secrets—home to the world’s largest mangrove forest (the Sundarbans), 120 km of empty golden sand at Cox’s Bazar, and vibrant river-city life in Dhaka and Barisal. You’ll meet unforgettable hospitality, feast on fiery street curries, and dive into centuries-old Sufi shrines without ever breaking your budget.
