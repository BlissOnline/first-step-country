Laos is Southeast Asia’s most enchanting budget destination—home to mist-shrouded temples in Luang Prabang, turquoise cascades at Kuang Si Falls, and the hedonistic river loops of Vang Vieng’s limestone karsts. Imagine slurping a bowl of khao soi for under $1, watching saffron-robed monks collect alms at dawn, and drifting past floating markets on the Mekong—all without draining your wallet. From hidden cave shrines to rolling tea plantations, Laos delivers off-beat thrills, postcard landscapes, and genuine Laotian hospitality at every turn.
